# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an HR Management System designed to streamline the recruitment and employee management process. The system will provide a centralized platform for creating job postings, managing candidates through a hiring pipeline, and maintaining an employee directory. The initial version (MVP) will focus on core functionalities to deliver value quickly.

# Core Features
The MVP will include the following core features:

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure login for HR personnel.
  - Basic role management (Admin/HR).

- **Job Management:**
  - Create, view, edit, and publish job postings.
  - Each job will have a title, description, and status (e.g., Draft, Published, Closed).

- **Candidate Management:**
  - A simple pipeline to track candidates (e.g., Applied, Interview, Hired).
  - Ability to view candidate details (name, contact info, resume).
  - A public link for each job to allow external applications.

- **Employee Management:**
  - A basic directory to list all employees.
  - View employee details (name, department, contact info).

# User Experience
The primary user persona for the MVP is the HR Manager.

- **Key User Flow:**
  1. The HR Manager logs into the system.
  2. Creates a new job posting for an open position.
  3. Shares the public job link.
  4. Candidates apply through the link.
  5. The HR Manager views applicants and moves them through the hiring pipeline.
  6. Once a candidate is hired, they are added to the Employee directory.

- **UI/UX Considerations:**
  - The interface will be clean, intuitive, and align with the provided UI/UX mockups.
  - Focus on ease of use for managing jobs and candidates efficiently.

# Technical Architecture
- **System Components:**
  - **Backend:** Node.js with NestJS framework.
  - **Database:** MongoDB for flexible data storage.
  - **API:** RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Data Models (MVP):**
  - **User:** `email`, `password`, `role`.
  - **Job:** `title`, `description`, `status`, `candidates`.
  - **Candidate:** `name`, `email`, `resumeUrl`, `status`.
  - **Employee:** `name`, `email`, `department`.

- **APIs and Integrations:**
  - No external integrations for the MVP.

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements:**
  - Implement all features listed under "Core Features".
  - The goal is a functional backend that can support the primary user flow.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Advanced reporting and analytics.
  - Calendar and To-do integration.
  - Customizable application forms and hiring pipelines.
  - Employee referral system.
  - Organizational structure editor.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Authentication:** Foundational for securing the system.
2.  **Job Management:** Core module that drives the recruitment process.
3.  **Candidate Management:** Directly depends on Jobs and is essential for the hiring workflow.
4.  **Employee Management:** The final step in the recruitment cycle.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Scope creep for the MVP.
- **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the defined MVP features. Defer all other features to future releases.

- **Risk:** Technical challenges with integrating the frontend and backend.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure clear API documentation and communication between frontend and backend teams.
